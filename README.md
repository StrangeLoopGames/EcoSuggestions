# Suggestion Tracker
We have moved our tracking for feature and improvement suggestions to Canny, which allows voting on feedback: https://feedback.play.eco.
Please feel free to use that tracker intensively, this repository has been archived and its existing suggestions will continue to serve us as inspiration for development.

Welcome to the Suggestion Tracker for our game Eco!

If you want to post a new suggestion, either click the "Issues" tab or click on this link: https://github.com/StrangeLoopGames/EcoSuggestions/issues

All your suggestions are appreciated. We do read, discuss and categorize them internally.
We try to give you feedback via comments and labels whenever it makes sense and we have time to do so, but it's not possible for us to comment on the majority of suggestions - that doesn't mean we don't read them.

Unfortunately, not every suggestion can make it into the game, so please don't be disappointed when we need to close suggestions that we are not going to implement to guarantee a good organisation. If this happens, your idea can still be very valueable and interesting for modders as they are able to implement stuff that might not fit our design goals :) 

### Posting a Suggestion
When posting a suggestion,  please follow these guidelines to help assist the developers:
- Search the already posted suggestions and check if your suggestion has already been posted
- **Only post a single suggestion per issue and make sure to explain it as in-depth as possible**

### Voting for Suggestions
We want to encourage you to discuss about suggestions in their comments and to vote for them if you like them.
If you like or dislike a suggestion, please give the opening post a thumbs-up (üëç) or thumbs-down (üëé) reaction. We do take those into account when discussing suggestions.

**Please note that ONLY thumbs-up (üëç) and thumbs-down (üëé) reactions are taken into account, any other reactions are not taken into account.**
